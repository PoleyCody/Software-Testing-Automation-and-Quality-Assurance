# Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance

•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is work and secure, I can use test cases, check requirements, and use outside sources. Using test cases with software automation I can find problems before they come to light. For example, if my program needs a string no longer than 10 in length the program should not allow a sting of 11 in length. Checking requirements for a program will ensure that the program meets the needs of the client and ensures the program does not have leaks where there should not be any. Using outside sources such as fellow workers to check or give feedback will allow me to adopt better techniques in my coding and development. 

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret the needs of client through the requirement of the program and if I have questions about the requirements, I ask them. When it comes to incorporating these requirements into the project, I use many different tools. Sometimes the client has minimum requirements such as the id must be in their database or sometimes it’s the client how adds information only. What ever the requirements I try to break it down to the most simples elements and then work from there. 

•	How do I approach designing software?

When I write code, I look at the requirements first before even writing a line of code. I read them over and over tell I get an idea of what the client wants and ask questions if I have any. I then write out what is need classes, methods, values, and find any formulas need for the program. For example, if a client said I need a program that finds the center of an object. I look for the formulas needed to find the center of a pyramid, a cube, cylinder, etc. I then create the classes, methods, values, and whatever is needed adding any check such as the sting can be only as long. Once this is completed, I then test the program to ensure the program is working as it should.
